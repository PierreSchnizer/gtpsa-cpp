C++ interface to gtpsa
======================

This code base is providing a shallow c++ wrapper to the
truncatad power series algebra module as provided in mad-ng
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD.
For details see
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD/blob/dev/src/libgtpsa/README.GTPSA.

All objects of the API are within the `gtpsa` namespace.

The following objects are considered to be part of the API:

* maximum description object of the power series class::`gtpsa::desc`
* truncated power series of doubles class::`gtpsa::tpsa`
* truncated power series of complex class::`gtpsa::ctpsa`

Furthermore functions are provided (e.g.
sin, cos, sinh, cosh, etc.)

Furthermore classes are provided that can be either
`Truncated Power Series Objects` or their base type.

There are `gtpsa::TpsaOrDouble` or
`gtpsa::CTpsaOrComplex`.
