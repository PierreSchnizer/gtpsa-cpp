C++ Interface to  Truncated Power Series Algebra module interface
=================================================================

This code base is providing a shallow c++ wrapper to the
truncatad power series algebra module as provided in mad-ng
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD.
For details see
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD/blob/dev/src/libgtpsa/README.GTPSA.

*NB*: the code base builds gtpsa as a library.

The wrapper covers a good fraction of what the gtpsa library provides.

If interested, you are welcome to join.
