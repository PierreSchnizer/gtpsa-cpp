C++ Interface to  Truncated Power Series Algebra module interface
=================================================================

This code base is providing a shallow c++ wrapper to the
truncatad power series algebra module as provided in mad-ng
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD.
For details see
https://github.com/MethodicalAcceleratorDesign/MAD/blob/dev/src/libgtpsa/README.GTPSA.


**NB**: this code base modifies the C function defintions of the original code. For serious work please checkout the original code, in particular if you are using the "C" language.


The wrapper code should be currently seen as an experiment of
how such a c++ style wrapper could be built.

If interested, you are welcome to join.
